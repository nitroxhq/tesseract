primitives (shouldve copied/sorted out in notion ugh haha)

objects
- everything is an object. all properties are tags.
    - there are defining object types (techinically still tags) that define what an object is; i.e. task, text/doc/note/jot (haha rhyme), time segment, whiteboard, etc...
    - there are custom object types that further define what an object is beyond the data type, such as "person" or "link"...
    - and there are object tags that add more information/context to an object and purpose (ie how it should be used), such as "youtube video" or "app"

ui
- primary actions
